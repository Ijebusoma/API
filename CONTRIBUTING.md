## Coding Style Guide
* Most important: Look around. Match the style you see used in the rest of the project. This includes formatting, naming things in code, naming things in documentation.

* Code MUST use 4 spaces for indenting, not tabs.

* There MUST NOT be a hard limit on line length; the soft limit MUST be 120
characters; lines SHOULD be 80 characters or less.

* There MUST be one blank line after the `namespace` declaration, and there
MUST be one blank line after the block of `use` declarations.

* Opening braces for classes MUST go on the next line, and closing braces MUST
go on the next line after the body.

* Opening braces for methods MUST go on the next line, and closing braces MUST
go on the next line after the body.

* Blank lines MAY be added to improve readability and to indicate related
blocks of code.

* The PHP constants `true`, `false`, and `null` MUST be in lower case.

* Prefer `'` over `"`
